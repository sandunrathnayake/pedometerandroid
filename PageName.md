The pedometer code will use the gravity sensor to measure the pendulum motion to count the steps.  Its progress is frozen right now waiting for more accurate sensors, we probably need at least readings per second from the gravity sensor for this app to be possible, the current rate on G1 is 4/sec.

The 10/sec number is an estimate, not a scientifically backed.
