The project is currently frozen since the accelerometer on the G1 does not take measurements fast enough.  However, the code is posted to allow owner of the Nexus or Droid to test it out in the newer hardware.

This project's is original in that it actually tries to count the steps, not merely approximate then trough other means.

The GUI is still in prototype state.
